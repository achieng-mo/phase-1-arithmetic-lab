//Solution 1:Create variable multiply to an equation that will multiply variables num1 and num2; 
//...the result of the multiplication should be 62.

let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;
console.log(multiply);

//Solution 2: Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log(random);

//Solution 3: Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; 
//...the remainder should be 4.

let num3 = 6
let num4 = 16
let mod = num4 % num3;
console.log(mod);

//Solution 4: Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20

const max = Math.max(3,14, 15, 20, 6, 18, 9);
console.log(max);
